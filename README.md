# loopr
##A minimal JavaScript library that provides chainable methods for arrays.

The **loopr** constructor can be accessed one of two ways.

```
var myRandomNumber = Loopr();
```

```
var myRandomNumber = l$();
```

You use the constructor to create a custom **loopr** object that provides you with several useful methods.
